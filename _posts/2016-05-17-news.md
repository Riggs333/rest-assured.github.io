* 2019-09-06: Johan elaborates on some of the benefits of using the new [Kotlin API](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#kotlin-extension-module) in [this](http://code.haleby.se/2019/09/06/rest-assured-in-kotlin/) blog post. 
* 2019-09-06: REST Assured [4.1.1](http://dl.bintray.com/johanhaleby/generic/rest-assured-4.1.1-dist.zip) is released. This is a very small release containing updates to jaxb-osgi and jaxb-apo dependencies which could lead to classpath inconsistencies if using newer versions of jaxb in Java 9+. Please see [change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/master/changelog.txt) for details.
* 2019-09-02: REST Assured [4.1.0](http://dl.bintray.com/johanhaleby/generic/rest-assured-4.1.0-dist.zip) is released. The main new feature is the [Kotlin Extensions Module](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#kotlin-extension-module) which provides useful extensions functions when working with Kotlin. It improves IDE formatting and allows all failed expectations to be reported at the same time. It's highly recommended for Kotlin users. Please see [change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/master/changelog.txt) for more details.
